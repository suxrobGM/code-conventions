# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive guide on implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in .NET projects. DDD is an approach to software development that centers the development on the domain model of the problem domain and its logic.

## Overview of DDD Architecture

DDD focuses on placing the primary project focus on the core domain and domain logic. It bases the software design on the model of the domain, which it continuously refines to more deeply reflect the domain complexities and nuances. By basing designs on a model, DDD enables a common language (ubiquitous language) that is shared between developers and domain experts. This alignment fosters better communication and understanding, resulting in software that genuinely meets the business requirements and is adaptable to change.

### Core Components of DDD

1. **Entities**: Objects that are distinguished by their identity, rather than their attributes.
2. **Value Objects**: Objects that describe certain aspects of the domain with no conceptual identity.
3. **Aggregates**: A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.
4. **Domain Events**: Events that are significant within the domain.
5. **Repositories**: Mechanisms for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior.
6. **Domain Services**: Stateless services that encapsulate domain logic.

### Advantages of DDD

1. **Alignment with Business Requirements**: By continuously refining the model to match the domain, the software remains closely aligned with business needs.
2. **Ubiquitous Language**: Promotes a common language that reduces the communication gap between domain experts and developers.
3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The clear separation and modularity of components make the system more adaptable to changes in business requirements or technology.
4. **Maintainability**: A well-structured, domain-centric design is inherently more maintainable and understandable.

### Drawbacks of DDD

1. **Complexity**: The depth of DDD can introduce complexity, especially in projects where domain complexity does not warrant it.
2. **Initial Investment**: It requires an upfront investment in understanding and modeling the domain, which may delay the start of coding.
3. **Need for Domain Experts**: Effective DDD requires continuous collaboration with domain experts, which may not always be feasible.
4. **Overengineering Risk**: There's a risk of overengineering solutions, especially in less complex domains where simpler design approaches might suffice.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into layers, each with its specific role and responsibility. The separation of concerns is clear, and the interaction between layers is well-defined.

### ProjectName.API

- **Role**: Serves as the entry point for the application. It's an ASP.NET Core Web API project that contains controllers.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handling HTTP requests and responses.
  - Delegating business logic to the Application layer.
  - Can access the Application and Infrastructure layer.
- **Note**: This layer is optional for projects that don't require a RESTful architecture and might directly interact with the Application and Infrastructure layers.

### ProjectName.Application

- **Role**: Acts as the coordinator or the mediator between the Domain and the outside world.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Contains application logic and task orchestration.
  - Define interfaces that the Infrastructure layer will implement, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
- **Note**: The Application layer should not have direct dependencies on the Infrastructure layer to maintain a clean separation and to ensure the domain logic is not coupled with external concerns.

### ProjectName.Domain

- **Role**: Represents the business and its rules. It's where the business's capabilities, rules, and logic reside.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Contains domain entities, domain services, value objects, and aggregates.
  - Defines interfaces for repositories (IRepository) and unit of work (IUnitOfWork).
  - Domain events for decoupling modules and components are also defined here.

### ProjectName.Infrastructure

- **Role**: Supports the Domain and Application layers with technical capabilities.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implements interfaces defined in the Domain layer (e.g., IRepository).
  - Interacts with the Database and contains Entity Framework Core database contexts.
  - Handles migrations, data access, and other infrastructure concerns.

### Shared Projects

#### ProjectName.Shared.Enums

- **Role**: Contains enums that are used across different layers and projects, ensuring consistency in the representation of common data types.
- **Note**: Utilize these shared enums judiciously to avoid unnecessary coupling between layers.

#### ProjectName.Shared.Models

- **Role**: Hosts Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that are used to transfer data between layers, especially between the API and client-side.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Only contains DTO classes.
  - Ensures that the domain model does not directly expose to the client and maintains a separation of concerns.
- **Note**: These shared projects are only utilized for projects with a REST API layer to prevent direct exposure of domain models to clients and to maintain a clear separation of concerns.

### General Guidelines

- **Layered Interaction**: Each layer should only interact with its adjacent layer. This keeps the code clean and maintainable.
- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies should only point inwards. The outer layers can depend on the inner layers, but not vice versa.
- **Isolation of Domain**: The Domain layer should be isolated and independent of other layers. It represents the business's truths and should not be influenced by external concerns.
- **Use of Shared Projects**: Shared projects should be used judiciously to avoid tight coupling. They should only contain truly shared and common elements.

By adhering to these guidelines and structuring your project according to DDD principles, you create a codebase that is aligned with business requirements, scalable, and maintainable. DDD helps in creating software that is flexible and able to adapt to changes in the business environment.

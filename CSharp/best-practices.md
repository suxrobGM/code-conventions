# C# Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices for writing C# code. These guidelines help ensure our codebase is maintainable, scalable, and efficient. While following these practices, always remember that every rule has exceptions.

## Code Organization and Readability

### 1. Follow SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: A class should only have one reason to change.
- **Open/Closed**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application.
- **Interface Segregation**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

### 2. Use Meaningful Structures and Names
- Organize your code into namespaces that reflect the functionality and layering of your application.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables.

## Performance

### 1. Avoid Unnecessary Allocations
- Be mindful of memory allocation and deallocation, particularly in performance-critical parts of the code.
- Use value types (`struct`) when small objects are frequently instantiated and do not survive long.

### 2. Utilize Caching
- Cache the results of expensive operations when the results are expected to be the same on subsequent calls.

## Asynchronous Programming

### Task vs ValueTask

- **Task**: Use `Task` for I/O-bound operations. It's suitable for operations that involve a significant amount of waiting, such as web requests or file I/O.

- **ValueTask**: Use `ValueTask` for methods that may complete synchronously and do not allocate memory for the task object in these cases. Ideal for performance-critical code sections.

### Returning Tasks Directly

- Directly return `Task` or `ValueTask` from methods when there is a single asynchronous operation. This approach avoids the overhead of an async state machine.

Example:
```csharp
public Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    return _httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
}
```

- Use `async` and `await` when you need to handle exceptions or perform multiple asynchronous operations for better readability and maintainability.

Example:
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    try
    {
        var response = await _httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
        // Additional processing
        return response;
    }
    catch (HttpRequestException e)
    {
        // Handle exception
        return default;
    }
}
```

## Resource Management

Implement the dispose pattern properly to manage resources efficiently. Always call `GC.SuppressFinalize(this)` in the Dispose method to prevent the garbage collector from calling the object's finalizer.

Example:
```csharp
public class Resource : IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposed = false; // Flag for detecting redundant dispose calls

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (_disposed)
        {
            return;
        }

        if (disposing)
        {
            // Dispose managed resources.
        }

        // Free unmanaged resources and set large fields to null.

        _disposed = true;
    }

    ~Resource()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```


## Error Handling

### 1. Use Exceptions Properly
- Throw exceptions for exceptional conditions, not for control flow.
- Catch only those exceptions you can handle.

### 2. Provide Useful Error Information
- When throwing exceptions, provide clear and concise information that would help in diagnosing the issue.

## Security

### 1. Validate Inputs
- Never trust external input. Validate input from all untrusted sources to protect against injection and other attacks.

### 2. Minimize Exposure of Sensitive Data
- Keep sensitive data, such as connection strings or credentials, out of the codebase. Use secure mechanisms like environment variables or secure configuration stores.

## Testing

### 1. Write Testable Code
- Design your code in a way that makes it easy to write unit tests. This often means following the SOLID principles mentioned above.

### 2. Cover Edge Cases
- Ensure your tests cover not only the expected paths but also the edge cases and error conditions.

## Documentation and Comments

### 1. Comment Wisely
- Prefer self-explanatory code over comments. When comments are necessary, make sure they are meaningful and up-to-date.

### 2. Keep Documentation Updated
- Keep your XML documentation, READMEs, and other documentation up-to-date with your code changes.


## Project Structure

Maintaining a consistent and intuitive project structure is crucial for project scalability, maintainability, and team collaboration. Adhering to a well-defined directory structure ensures that team members can easily locate files, understand the project architecture, and contribute more effectively. Below are the conventions we follow for organizing project files:

### Source Files

- Place all source files within the `src` directory at the root of the project. This directory should contain all the application logic, code, and resources that are necessary for the application to run.

Example structure:
```plaintext
/src
|-- /ProjectName.Application
    |-- /Controllers
    |-- /Models
    |-- /Views
    |-- /Services
    |-- ProjectName.Application.csproj
```

- Organize the `src`` directory further based on the logical components of the application, such as Client, Core, Shared, Server, etc., depending on your project's architecture and design patterns.

### Test Files
- Place all test projects and test files within the test directory at the root of the project. This separation emphasizes the distinction between production code and test code.

```plaintext
/test
|-- /ProjectName.UnitTests
    |-- /Fixtures
    |-- /Tests
    |-- ProjectName.UnitTests.csproj

|-- /ProjectName.IntegrationTests
    |-- /Fixtures
    |-- /Tests
    |-- ProjectName.IntegrationTests.csproj

```

## General Guidelines
Ensure that the solution file (.sln) is at the root of the project, encompassing both the `src` and `test` directories. This allows for easy navigation and management of the project's components.

Adopt a naming convention that clearly differentiates between production code and test code, e.g., `CompanyName.ProjectName` for the main project and `CompanyName.ProjectName.Tests` for the test project.

- Organize the `test` directory to reflect the structure of the src directory. This makes it easier to find the tests related to a specific piece of functionality.

## Continuous Improvement

- Stay updated with the latest C# features and .NET developments. Regularly review and refactor the code to leverage new language features and best practices.

# CQRS Pattern in Project

This document provides guidelines and best practices for implementing the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern in .NET projects. The CQRS pattern separates read and update operations for a data store, improving scalability, performance, and maintainability.

## Overview of CQRS

### Benefits

- **Scalability**: By separating the read and write models, you can scale each independently, optimizing performance and resource utilization.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes the system more maintainable and understandable.
- **Flexibility**: You can optimize the read and write sides of the system separately according to their specific needs.

### Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Introducing CQRS can add complexity to the system, particularly in scenarios where traditional CRUD operations would suffice.
- **Consistency**: The eventual consistency model can be a paradigm shift and might introduce complexity when dealing with data synchronization between the read and write models.

## Implementing CQRS in the Project

### Using MediatR and FluentValidation

- Utilize `MediatR` for mediating commands and queries.
- Employ `FluentValidation` for validating commands and queries.

### Project Structure

#### Application Project Structure

- The Application project should contain `Commands` and `Queries` folders.
- Inside the `Commands` and `Queries` folders, organize subfolders by `{EntityName}/{ActionName}`.

#### Commands Structure

- For each command, create a subfolder `{EntityName}/{ActionName}` under the `Commands` folder.
- Inside each `{ActionName}` subfolder, create the following C# files:
  - `{ActionName}Command.cs`: The command itself.
  - `{ActionName}Handler.cs`: The handler that executes the command.
  - `{ActionName}Validator.cs`: Validation rules for the command using `FluentValidation`.

Example structure:
```plaintext
/Commands
|-- /Product/CreateProduct
    |-- CreateProductCommand.cs
    |-- CreateProductHandler.cs
    |-- CreateProductValidator.cs
```

### Queries Structure
For each query, create a subfolder `{EntityName}/{ActionName}` under the `Queries` folder.

- Inside each `{ActionName}` subfolder, create the following C# files:
    - `{ActionName}Query.cs`: The query itself.
    - `{ActionName}Handler.cs`: The handler that executes the query.
    - `{ActionName}Validator.cs`: (Optional) Validation rules for the query using `FluentValidation`, if applicable.

Example structure:
```plaintext
/Queries
|-- /Product/GetAllProducts
    |-- GetAllProductsQuery.cs
    |-- GetAllProductsHandler.cs
    |-- GetAllProductsValidator.cs (if needed)
```

## General Guidelines
- Keep the command and query handlers focused and concise. Each handler should only execute a single command or query.
- Follow the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) when implementing CQRS, ensuring that the domain logic and model are the primary drivers of design.
- Test the command and query handlers thoroughly, ensuring they behave as expected.

By following these guidelines and best practices for implementing CQRS with MediatR and FluentValidation, you can build a robust, scalable, and maintainable application.
